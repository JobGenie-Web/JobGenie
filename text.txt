in here company details take first in a form. then after validate Business Registration certificate go to admin register form. it should be a wizard. 1st step company and 2nd step admin. then click the signup button. 

Use Zod for validaion. 


in here candidate after successfully login check  profile_completed  status. if it is false redirect to create profile page. if it is true redirect to dashboard. in create profile I want to collect all data of the candidate


use Zod, Shadcn components and keep consistancy with the other pages and functionalities. I need the fastest application. there fore use optimized queries here. follow a clean and clear file and folder structure.


@mcp:supabase-mcp-server: act as a senior software engineer. now I want to store cv in supabase. after candidate extracting data from the cv when candidate create the profile cv should store in supabase storage. there should a resume folder and cv should save in a folder named with relevant candidate id in resume folder. then resume url should save under resume_url in candidate table. but when storing cv want to add the logo as a watermark to the cv.

Also both create profile and store cv tasks must do in same time. if any task fail. other task must stop. so if fail to create candidate cannot store cv and if fail to store cv cannot create profile. logo is in public folder

deeply gothrough the codebase and supabase.  use Shadcn components and keep consistancy with the other pages and functionalities. I need the fastest application. there fore use optimized queries here. follow a clean and clear file and folder structure.
