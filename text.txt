in here company details take first in a form. then after validate Business Registration certificate go to admin register form. it should be a wizard. 1st step company and 2nd step admin. then click the signup button. 

Use Zod for validaion. 


in here candidate after successfully login check  profile_completed  status. if it is false redirect to create profile page. if it is true redirect to dashboard. in create profile I want to collect all data of the candidate


use Zod, Shadcn components and keep consistancy with the other pages and functionalities. I need the fastest application. there fore use optimized queries here. follow a clean and clear file and folder structure.
